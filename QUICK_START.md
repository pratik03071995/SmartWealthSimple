# ðŸš€ Quick Start - Fix Your Website Connection

## The Problem
Your frontend (Vercel) can't connect to your backend (Railway) due to CORS issues.

## âœ… The Solution (Already Applied)
I've fixed the CORS configuration in your backend and improved error handling in your frontend.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You Need to Do

### Option 1: Use the Automated Script (Recommended)
```bash
./deploy_fix.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

#### Step 1: Deploy Backend
```bash
cd app
git add .
git commit -m "Fix CORS configuration"
git push origin main
```

#### Step 2: Deploy Frontend
```bash
cd web
git add .
git commit -m "Add better API handling"
git push origin main
```

#### Step 3: Wait & Test
- Wait 2-3 minutes for deployments
- Open https://smart-wealth-simple.vercel.app/
- Test Sectors and Earnings pages

## ðŸ§ª Test Your Fix
Open `test_connection.html` in your browser to verify all endpoints work.

## ðŸ“‹ Expected Results
- âœ… No CORS errors in browser console
- âœ… Sectors page loads with data
- âœ… Earnings page shows calendar
- âœ… All API calls work from Vercel

## ðŸ†˜ If Still Broken
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify Railway deployment succeeded
3. Check the detailed guide in `DEPLOYMENT_FIX_GUIDE.md`

Your website should work perfectly after these steps! ðŸŽ‰
